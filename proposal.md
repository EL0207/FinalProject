# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Discord Bot, Multiple Purpose

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Just a Discord bot, maybe put a search engine in it or we could have a meme generator.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Discord bot. We will try our best to make it multi purpose and have it do a couple a things. It should, at the bare minimum play music and fetch lyrics. We were thinking of having it find deals on products we search for. Maybe also have a search engine that can return results like having Google right on the discord server. I think we would have to use discord.py.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Have it welcome new members that join. Play music and detect offensive messages.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have a search engine, a command that finds deals, and maybe a meme generator. Along with all the basic functions like play music.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A multi purpose discord bot. Have it do everything.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

This'll be my first project I ever done. Hopefully it'll be fine. There's also many videos online that I'm sure will help my partner and I.
